# circuitHTN
Repository to host software libraries for task models for human-robot collaboration. A circuitHTN is a Hierarchical Task Network inspired from resistor reduction rules in elementary physics. Humans demonstrations are first collected to build an Action Graph representing the state action transitions. The graph needs to be reduced to discover potential action hierarchies and structure. The graph reduction has three parts: series-parallel resistor reduction, identifying first common successor and restructuring graph to resolve ambiguities.
